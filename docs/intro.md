The CX Handbook is designed to educate CX Professionals and Startup Execs on the best practices to setup and run customer-facing teams such as Customer Support and Customer Success. It was born out of Zach's experiences running teams at high-growth companies, and the recognition that patterns emerge across different companies and industries.

- The CX Handbook is inspired by the [High Growth Handbook, by Elad Gil](http://growth.eladgil.com/). The gap that we noticed in Elad’s book was that it skips conversations about the customer. Instead, it focuses on important topics such as fundraising, growth (duh!), and product management. The content also seems to be entirely focused on the CEO as its audience.
- The amount of centralized and substantive information about Customer-facing roles (Customer Experience (CX), Customer Support (CS), etc) is low. Traditionally, there are very fragmented thoughts on the topic spread across (company) blogs to market their product/service, podcasts, or an individual’s blog.


## How to use the CX Handbook
